              <p class="pmain" style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: -40px; margin-right: 610px;">Lack of Marketing and Storage facilities:</p>
              <p class="pmain" style="font-size: 20px;"> Problems faced by farmers in agricultural marketing include transportation costs, inadequate market infrastructure, price fluctuation, lack of proper market information, and the role of exploiting local traders and middlemen. Lack of storage facilities in rural areas has been a limiting factor for post-harvest losses. Nearly 16% of fruits and vegetables, 10% of oilseeds, 9% of pulses, and 6% of cereals produced are being wasted every year due to lack of storage facilities. Since most of the agricultural produce is perishable, farmers are distressed to sell the produce immediately after harvest even at lower prices. This gives them a meager income. Insufficient storage facilities make it difficult for the farmers to meet people’s demands during the off-season.</p>
              <p class="pmain" style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: -40px; margin-right: 635px;">Impact of climate change:</p>
              <p class="pmain" style="font-size: 20px;">Climate change can lead to changes in weather patterns, such as increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like droughts, floods, and storms. These changes can affect soil fertility, crop yields and livestock production, leading to reduced productivity and income for farmers. Farmers may need to invest more in pest and disease management practices, which can increase their costs and reduce their profits. Heat waves can cause heat stress in crops, which affects the yield especially when they occur during pollination, pod or fruit set. Climate change can lead to water scarcity in some regions which can affect irrigation and reduce yield. Farmers may be forced to rely on rain-fed agriculture, which can be more unpredictable and vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
                Unpredictable rainfall affects several agricultural operations and unexpected rainfall during harvest will lead to total crop loss. </p>
                <p class="pmain" style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: -40px; margin-right: 730px;">Price volatility:</p>
                <p class="pmain" style="font-size: 20px;">Price volatility can have a significant impact on the livelihoods of farmers, especially small farmers who are more vulnerable to market fluctuations. Price volatility can lead to income instability for farmers as sudden drops in prices can reduce their income and profits. This can make it difficult for farmers to plan and invest in their farms, leading to a vicious cycle of poverty and low productivity. This situation creates uncertainty for farmers as they are not sure of the prices they will receive for their produce in the future. This makes it difficult for farmers to make informed decisions about what crops to grow, how much to produce, and when to sell their produce.</p>

            <p class="pmain" style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: -40px; margin-right: 623px;">Soil fertility depletion:</p>
            <p class="pmain">Imbalanced use of urea leads to soil fertility depletion over a period of time. In the year 2022-23, urea accounts for more than half of the total fertilizer production (58.4%) total consumption (57.9%), and 35.9% of imports. Other causes of soil depletion include a lack of proper cropping systems and continuous cultivation. In India, the total area under the monocropping system during the year 2015-16 was approximately 52.8 million hectares, which is about 47% of the total cropped area.</p>
            <p class="pmain" style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: -40px; margin-right: 623px;">Poor training and extension facilities:</p>
            <p class="pmain">Agricultural extension programmes help farmers by means of transfer of technology, assisting farmers in problem-solving and contributing to rural development. But extension system in India is not equally balanced. Without adequate training and access to extension services, farmers may not be aware of the latest farming practices, techniques and technologies that can help them to increase crop yields. This results in reduced yield, which can affect farmer’s income</p>
